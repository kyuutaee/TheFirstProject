        <p>In this course we will provide a thorough and elaborate study of interactive concepts and techniques for applications. We will conduct an extensive investigation into the interface, mechanism, controls, and aims of interactive works. Students will learn how to design and develop complex interactive projects, undertaking comprehensive research and directing their thinking process from brainstorming to final outcome. This course will provide students with the tools to conceive, plan, and develop an interactive system, and they will become aware of the importance of their role in the development of interactive media.

        <br>
        <p>
	       Choose a conversation between two or more people. They can be interviews, dialogues, debates, etc. Build two pages that feature the same conversation, each designed and styled and typeset differently. With each site, consider your interpretation of the text when setting your type (ie typeface, size, format, margins, etc) and consider how these decisions alter the meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
	        For the first site, make legibility and function you’re main concern. What is the best format for this text that allows the viewer to experience the writing while also helping users understand which person is speaking. Use only one typeface and one color. 
        </p>

        <p>
	        For the second site, expression and tone are your main concerns. How would you set the type if you were less concerned about legibility? How can the structure of the text relate to the essay in a more visceral way? It’s still important to know who’s speaking when, but does it have to be legible? Is there a way to convey the original premise and tone the author intended without reading it? Multiple typefaces, shapes, and colors are allowed.

	        Visit your given location and spend as much time there as you need. Take pictures, notes, and get inspired without leaving that spot. Think about what’s unique about this space. Find some form of inspiration from it and consider how you can show it to someone else. You will be creating a map of this area to show a user what you find interesting. Next week bring in a presentation of what you saw and experienced as well as your ideas for what you want your map to show. 
        </p>

        <p>
		      What is interesting about your area? Is it the terrain? Are there interesting land marks? Is it the sound or the smell? Whatever it is, try to pick something that is either overlooked or something you can provide a unique perspective. Look out for systems, patterns, colors, sounds, people, feelings, etc.

	        Based off your findings from your location, focus on something that can evolve into a type of collection. This can be anything from text, sounds, patterns, objects, etc. You can begin to think more abstractly or loose with your themes, but there should be some linear connection to your visit at your location. Gather an image bank of 50–75 reference images based off of your collection. Organize these images into 3-6 more specific categories (for example if your collection is stripes, categories could be direction, size, color). At this point you should be finding similarities, drawing connections, and developing a concept or narrative for your collection. Be prepared to discuss in class.

		       Finally, Begin developing your collection into a website. How can you display these items in a way that highlights your overall message or connections you’ve found with your collections? What aspects of the web can you leverage in displaying these items? How does the user move between them and how are they filtered? Are there multiple ways to viewing this collection? If it’s primarly visual, how would it translate to text and vice versa. Do they represent a finite list or can users add to it? How does seeing these as a collection or a larger system alter or enhance their meaning?

  <h3 id="notification">Assignment 3: GAME (Feedback Loop)</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
	        Gamification is the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts. How are different platforms and websites designed to specifically encourage addictive behavior. How can the same constant interaction feel new each time through slight deviation in positive reinforcement? Are there instances where it’s negative? 
        </p>

        <p>
	        Create a game with a goal in mind. Your game should have a clear objective of what you want the user to do or accomplish. Do you want to teach them something? Make a point? Waste their time? Whatever it is, make all of your decisions built around achieving this goal. Your game should have no clear or finite ending and should have a high replay value.
